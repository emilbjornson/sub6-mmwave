function a = functionSpatialSignature3DLoS(U,varphi,theta,lambda)
%Compute the spatial signature using the 3D LoS model defined in Section
%7.3.1.
%
%INPUT:
%U        = 3 x M matrix containing the positions of the M antennas
%varphi   = Azimuth angle in radians
%theta    = Elevation angle in radians
%
%OUTPUT:
%a        = M x 1 spatial signature vector

%Define the wave vector in (7.11)
k = 2*pi/lambda * [cos(varphi)*cos(theta); sin(varphi)*cos(theta); sin(theta)];

%Compute the spatial signature as in (7.12)
a = transpose(exp(1i* k'*U));
